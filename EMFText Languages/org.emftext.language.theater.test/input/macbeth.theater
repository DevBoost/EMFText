	As seemeth by his plight, of the Reuolt
	The newest state"
	
	   Mal: "This is the Serieant,
	Who like a good and hardie Souldier fought
	'Gainst my Captiuitie: Haile braue friend;
	Say to the King, the knowledge of the Broyle,
	As thou didst leaue it"
	
	   Cap: "Doubtfull it stood,
	As two spent Swimmers, that doe cling together,
	And choake their Art: The mercilesse Macdonwald
	(Worthie to be a Rebell, for to that
	The multiplying Villanies of Nature
	Doe swarme vpon him) from the Westerne Isles
	Of Kernes and Gallowgrosses is supply'd,
	And Fortune on his damned Quarry smiling,

	Disdayning Fortune, with his brandisht Steele,
	Which smoak'd with bloody execution
	(Like Valours Minion) caru'd out his passage,

	   Cap: "As whence the Sunne 'gins his reflection,
	Shipwracking Stormes, and direfull Thunders:
	So from that Spring, whence comfort seem'd to come,
	Discomfort swells: Marke King of Scotland, marke,
	No sooner Iustice had, with Valour arm'd,

	   King: "Dismay'd not this our Captaines, Macbeth and
	Banquoh?"
	
	  Cap: "Yes, as Sparrowes, Eagles;
	Or the Hare, the Lyon:
	If I say sooth, I must report they were
	As Cannons ouer-charg'd with double Cracks,
	So they doubly redoubled stroakes vpon the Foe:
	Except they meant to bathe in reeking Wounds,
	Or memorize another Golgotha,
	I cannot tell: but I am faint,

	Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,
	Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
	The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
	Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,

	So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
	That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
	And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
	That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
	By each at once her choppie finger laying

	   Banquo: "Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
	Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
	Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
	Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
	You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
	Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
	That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
	If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
	And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,

	   Macb: "Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
	By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,
	But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues
	A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
	Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
	No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
	You owe this strange Intelligence, or why

	[Witches vanish.]
	
	  Banquo: "The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,

	Would they had stay'd"
	
	   Banquo: "Were such things here, as we doe speake about?

	   Macb: "And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?"
	   
	  Banquo: "Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?
	Enter Rosse and Angus."
	
	  Rosse: "The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,
	The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
	Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
	His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
	Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
	In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
	He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
	Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
	Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
	Can post with post, and euery one did beare
	Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
	And powr'd them downe before him"
	
	   Ang: "Wee are sent,
	To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
	Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
	Not pay thee"
	
	   Rosse: "And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
	He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
	In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
	For it is thine"
	
	   Banquo: "What, can the Deuill speake true?"
	  Macb: "The Thane of Cawdor liues:
	Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?"
	
	  Ang: "Who was the Thane, liues yet,
	But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
	Which he deserues to loose.
	Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
	Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
	And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
	In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
	But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
	Haue ouerthrowne him"
	
	   Macb: "Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:
	The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
	Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
	When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,
	Promis'd no lesse to them"
	
	   Banquo: "That trusted home,
	Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
	Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
	And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
	The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
	Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
	In deepest consequence.
	Cousins, a word, I pray you"
	
	   Macb: "Two Truths are told,
	As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
	Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
	This supernaturall solliciting
	Cannot be ill; cannot be good.
	If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
	Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
	If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
	Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
	And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
	Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
	Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
	My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
	Shakes so my single state of Man,
	That Function is smother'd in surmise,
	And nothing is, but what is not"
	
	   Banquo: "Looke how our Partner's rapt"
	
	   Macb: "If Chance will haue me King,
	Why Chance may Crowne me,
	Without my stirre"
	
	   Banquo: "New Honors come vpon him
	Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
	But with the aid of vse"
	
	   Macb: "Come what come may,
	Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day"
	
	   Banquo: "Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure"
	
	   Macb: "Giue me your fauour:
	My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
	Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
	Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
	To reade them.
	Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon

	  King: "Is execution done on Cawdor?
	Or not those in Commission yet return'd?"
	
	  Mal: "My Liege, they are not yet come back.
	But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
	Who did report, that very frankly hee
	Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
	And set forth a deepe Repentance:
	Nothing in his Life became him,
	Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
	As one that had beene studied in his death,
	To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
	As 'twere a carelesse Trifle"
	
	   King: "There's no Art,
	To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
	He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
	An absolute Trust."
	
	[Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.]
	
	King: "O worthyest Cousin,
	The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
	Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
	That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
	To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
	That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
	Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
	More is thy due, then more then all can pay"
	
	   Macb: "The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
	In doing it, payes it selfe.
	Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
	And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
	Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
	By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
	And Honor"
	
	   King: "Welcome hither:
	I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
	To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
	That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
	No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,

	   King: "My plenteous Ioyes,
	Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
	In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
	And you whose places are the nearest, know,
	We will establish our Estate vpon

	The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
	Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,

	The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
	So humbly take my leaue"
	
	   King: "My worthy Cawdor"
	
	   Macb: "The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
	On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,
	For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
	Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:

	  King: "True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,
	And in his commendations, I am fed:
	It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,

	further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
	Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
	the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
	before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to

	Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be

	So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
	Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against
	The deepe damnation of his taking off:
	And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
	Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
	Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
	Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
	That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
	To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
	Vaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,
	And falles on th' other."
	
	[Enter Lady.]
	
	Macb: "How now? What Newes?"
	
	  Lady: "He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?"
	  
	  Macb: "Hath he ask'd for me?"
	  
	  Lady: "Know you not, he ha's?"
	  
	  Macb: "We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
	He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
	Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
	Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
	Not cast aside so soone"
	
	   Lady: "Was the hope drunke,
	Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
	And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
	At what it did so freely? From this time,
	Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
	To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
	As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
	Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
	And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
	Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
	Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage"
	
	   Macb: "Prythee peace:
	I dare do all that may become a man,
	Who dares do more, is none"
	
	   Lady: "What Beast was't then
	That made you breake this enterprize to me?
	When you durst do it, then you were a man:
	And to be more then what you were, you would
	Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
	Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
	They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
	Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
	How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
	I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
	Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
	And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
	As you haue done to this"
	
	   Macb: "If we should faile?"
	  Lady: "We faile?
	But screw your courage to the sticking place,
	And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
	(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
	Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
	Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
	That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
	Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
	A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
	Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
	What cannot you and I performe vpon
	Th' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon
	His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
	Of our great quell"
	
	   Macb: "Bring forth Men-Children onely:
	For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
	Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
	When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
	Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
	That they haue don't?"
	
	  Lady: "Who dares receiue it other,
	As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
	Vpon his Death?"
	
	  Macb: "I am settled, and bend vp
	Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
	Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
	False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know."
	
	[Exeunt.]
