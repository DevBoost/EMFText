  	<p>To create parsers, printers and editors with EMFTextEdit several steps have to be made. Figure 2 shows an activity diagram
  	roughly depicting the necessary steps.

    Starting point usually is the Ecore based model serving as an abstract syntax and as a skeleton for concrete syntax. The model can be a  
  	graph or tree definition. Although Ecore models are specified as XML files, it is recommended  to use the Ecore model 
  	editor or an other graphical editor to create and edit such models. To later unambiguously refer models, users
  	have to specify a unique namespace (property NS URI in the .ecore file) for their models as well as a package name . 
  	To enable EMFTextEdit to use models at runtime,
  	a model plugin must be generated. For this, EMF provides a generation-metamodel (GenModel) allowing to enrich Ecore models with specific
  	information for code generation. The EMF Model wizard facilitates the creation of GenModels.<br>
  	The next step is to define the base package 
  	name which will be the common prefix for all subsequently generated Java packages. After finishing configuration, the EMF model plugin 
  	is ready to be generated. EMFTextEdit will later use these classes to construct a model instance.

    Since now our metamodel is defined, we can start to specify our concrete Syntax. For this, a textual specification has to be written, which has the
    ending <span class="emphasis"><em>cs</em></span>. It consists of four sections: In the first part, a unique name has to be specified. This name later will be used to 
	refer to the syntax as a specific resource type. Furthermore, the metamodel, whose textual syntax shall be defined, has to be referenced by its 
	unique namespace URI and a start symbol must be selected from the model elements. In the second part, productions from other concrete syntax specifications can be imported. 
	This is especially useful if the metamodel is compositionally structured, e.g. reuses large parts from other models which have an already specified concrete syntax. 
	The third part allows for specifying token types as it is usual for parser generators, but in contrast, EMFTextEdit also allows to leave them out: If no token definitions are given,
	default rules are used. Another specialty for token definitions are optional pre- and suffixes which are transparently removed (after parsing) and added (before printing) 
	by the generated token resolvers. And last but not least, EBNF like productions have to be defined for each non-abstract model element reachable from the start symbol. They have to be defined
	with respect to the attributes and references of the model element and thus do not contain nonterminals in the classic sense.
