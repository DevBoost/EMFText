 * Cct5LayoutInformationAdapters are attached to EObjects and aggregate multiple
 * LayoutInformation objects. Each of these objects contains the layout that was
 * found before a keyword, attribute or reference.

 * Since layout information is stored in EAdapters, models can be transformed and
 * modified, while still keeping the formatting of the original text document from
